# FlightRiskRadar: AI-Powered Aviation Intelligence Platform

## Project Title
**FlightRiskRadar** - Real-Time Aviation Analytics & AI Sentiment Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement
The aviation industry processes millions of flights annually, generating vast amounts of operational data and customer feedback across multiple touchpoints. Airlines, airports, and travelers struggle to synthesize this information into actionable insights. Traditional analytics fail to capture the nuanced relationship between operational performance metrics and customer sentiment, leaving critical patterns hidden in disconnected datasets. Our challenge was to leverage Google BigQuery's AI capabilities to uncover these hidden correlations, predict risk factors, and deliver real-time sentiment analysis that transforms raw aviation data into strategic intelligence.

## Impact Statement
FlightRiskRadar revolutionizes aviation decision-making by providing stakeholders with unprecedented visibility into the correlation between operational performance and customer satisfaction. By processing 3 years of historical flight data (2016-2018) covering millions of flights and combining it with real-time AI-generated sentiment analysis, our platform enables airlines to proactively address service issues before they escalate, helps airports optimize operations based on predicted delay patterns, and empowers travelers to make informed decisions based on comprehensive performance metrics. The platform's AI-driven insights have the potential to reduce flight delays by 15-20%, improve customer satisfaction scores by 25%, and save the industry millions in operational costs through predictive risk mitigation.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline & BigQuery Integration
- **Dataset**: 3 years of US domestic flight data (2016-2018) with 15+ million records
- **BigQuery Tables**:
  - `flights_2016`, `flights_2017`, `flights_2018` - Historical flight performance
  - `airline_reviews` - Customer feedback data
  - `airport_places_data` - Airport metadata and Google reviews
  - `airport_ai_insights` - ML-generated sentiment analysis

### AI/ML Components

#### 1. BigQuery ML.GENERATE_TEXT Implementation
We leveraged BigQuery's native ML.GENERATE_TEXT with Gemini 1.5 Flash for real-time sentiment generation:

```sql
-- Detective Track: Uncover hidden patterns
ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
  MODEL `gemini-1.5-flash-002`,
  CONCAT(
    'Analyze airport data and uncover patterns:',
    'Performance Metrics:', performance_data,
    'Identify: seasonal patterns, correlations, challenges'
  ),
  STRUCT(0.2 AS temperature, 1024 AS max_output_tokens)
)
```

#### 2. Cloud Functions for On-Demand Analysis
- **airline-sentiment-analysis**: Generates airline-specific sentiment with unique personality profiles
- **airport-sentiment-analysis**: Provides location-based sentiment intelligence
- **airline-performance-analysis**: Real-time performance metrics aggregation

### Frontend Innovation

#### Interactive Visualizations
- **3D Globe Visualization**: Real-time flight paths with delay heat mapping
- **Sentiment Heatmaps**: Category-based sentiment analysis (Customer Service, On-Time Performance, Comfort, Value, Food)
- **Performance Dashboards**: Dynamic charts showing trends, predictions, and anomalies

#### Responsive Design
- Dark/Light mode with system preference detection
- Multi-language support with real-time translation
- Mobile-optimized responsive layouts

### 4. AI-Powered Sentiment Engine
Our sentiment analysis goes beyond simple positive/negative classification:

**Airline-Specific Personalities**: Each airline has unique feedback tailored to their actual service characteristics:
- Delta: "industry-leading operational reliability and professional customer service"
- Southwest: "unique no-change-fee policy and two free checked bags"
- Spirit: "ultra-low base fares but aggressive fee structure"

**Dynamic Sentiment Generation**: Based on real performance metrics:
- High performers (4.0+ rating): 65% positive, 25% neutral, 10% negative
- Low performers (<3.0 rating): 25% positive, 35% neutral, 40% negative

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### BigQuery Optimization
```sql
-- Aggregate performance with seasonal analysis
WITH flight_performance AS (
  SELECT
    origin AS airport_code,
    AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_delay,
    AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM fl_date) IN (12,1,2)
        THEN dep_delay END) AS winter_delays,
    AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM fl_date) IN (6,7,8)
        THEN dep_delay END) AS summer_delays
  FROM flights_combined
  GROUP BY origin
)
```

### On-Demand Loading Pattern
Instead of loading all sentiment data upfront, we implemented lazy-loading:
```javascript
const loadAISummaryForAirline = async (airlineCode) => {
  if (airlinesAISummaries[airlineCode]) return; // Cache check

  const sentimentResponse = await flightRiskAPI.getAirlineSentimentAnalysis(
    airlineCode, avgRating, reviewCount
  );
  setAirlinesAISummaries(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [airlineCode]: sentimentResponse
  }));
};
```

### Unique Sentiment Profiles
Each airline maintains distinct personality in feedback:
```python
airline_profiles = {
  'UA': {
    'strengths': ['extensive route network', 'modern fleet'],
    'challenges': ['customer service consistency'],
    'unique_features': ['Polaris business class']
  },
  # ... unique profiles for all carriers
}
```
